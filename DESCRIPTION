Description: Provides R bindings to the PMTiles command-line interface for
    working with PMTiles archives. PMTiles is a single-file archive format for
    tiled data that enables efficient cloud-native storage and retrieval of map tiles.
    This package wraps the go-pmtiles CLI to provide functions for inspecting,
    extracting, converting, and serving PMTiles archives.
