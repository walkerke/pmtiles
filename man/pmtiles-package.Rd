\title{pmtiles: R Interface to PMTiles}
\description{
Provides R bindings to the PMTiles command-line interface for working with
PMTiles archives. PMTiles is a single-file archive format for tiled data
that enables efficient cloud-native storage and retrieval of map tiles.
}
\details{
# PMTiles Format

PMTiles is a single-file archive format for pyramids of tiled data, designed
to be hosted on commodity storage and accessed on-demand over HTTP. It is
designed for efficient storage and retrieval of map tiles from cloud storage
without requiring a tile server.

# Main Functions

**Inspecting Archives:**
- [pm_show()]: Display archive information and metadata
- [pm_verify()]: Verify archive structure
- [pm_version()]: Get CLI version

**Working with Tiles:**
- [pm_tile()]: Extract a single tile
- [pm_extract()]: Create subset archive by region or zoom

**Converting and Optimizing:**
- [pm_convert()]: Convert MBTiles to PMTiles
- [pm_cluster()]: Optimize archive layout

**Cloud Operations:**
- [pm_upload()]: Upload archive to cloud storage
- [pm_edit()]: Edit archive header or metadata

# Cloud Storage Support

PMTiles supports reading from and writing to cloud storage:
- Amazon S3 and S3-compatible storage (Cloudflare R2, MinIO, etc.)
- Azure Blob Storage
- Google Cloud Storage

Authentication uses standard cloud provider environment variables.

# System Requirements

The package includes pre-compiled binaries for common platforms:
- macOS (Intel and Apple Silicon)
- Linux (amd64 and arm64)
- Windows (amd64 and arm64)

If pre-compiled binaries are not available for your platform, you'll need
Go (>= 1.19) installed to build from source during package installation.
