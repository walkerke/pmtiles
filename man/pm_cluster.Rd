}
\arguments{
\item{input}{Path to input PMTiles file. The file will be modified in place.}

\item{no_deduplication}{Logical. If `TRUE`, skips tile deduplication to
speed up clustering. Use this if you know the input has only unique tiles.
Default is `FALSE`.}

\item{verbose}{Logical. If `TRUE`, prints progress information. Default is `TRUE`.}
}
\value{
Invisibly returns the path to the clustered archive.
}
\description{
Cluster an unclustered PMTiles archive, optimizing its size and layout.
Archives created by tippecanoe, planetiler, and the pmtiles CLI are already
clustered and do not need this operation.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
# Cluster an archive
pm_cluster("archive.pmtiles")

# Cluster without deduplication (faster)
pm_cluster("archive.pmtiles", no_deduplication = TRUE)
}
